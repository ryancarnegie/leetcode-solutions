Two Sum

Brute Force Method
This method runs at O(n^2) time complexity

for i in range(0, len(nums)):
  for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
      sum = nums[i] + nums[j]
      if sum == target:
        return [i, j]
        
       
Reverse Search Brute Force Method
Also runs at O(n^2) time complexity

for i in range(0, len(nums)):
  for j in range(i, len(nums - 1)):
    sum = nums[i] + nums[j]:
    if sum == target:
    return [i, j]
   
The algorithm above uses the first loop to search each element of the array
The second loop starts at the end and works backwards, in reverse. When it finds the first match to the first loop moving forward, it returns the result of the indices

The algorithm below uses a hashmap or dictionary in Python.
